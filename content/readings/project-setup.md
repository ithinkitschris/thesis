- **Categorized entries** under research, findings, notes, and references
- **Tag-based organization** for cross-cutting themes
- **Markdown support** for easy writing and formatting
- **Static site generation** for fast loading and easy deployment

## File Structure

```
content/
├── research/     # Research methodology, literature reviews
├── findings/     # Key discoveries and results
├── notes/        # General observations and thoughts
└── references/   # Citations and bibliography
```

## Writing Process

To add new content:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate category folder
2. Add frontmatter with title, date, tags, and excerpt
3. Write content in markdown format
4. Refresh the site to see updates

## Tools and Software

- **Documentation**: This custom Next.js platform
- **Reference Management**: To be determined
- **Version Control**: Git repository
- **Backup**: Regular commits and cloud storage

## Daily Workflow

1. Morning: Review previous day's notes
2. Research/Work: Document findings in real-time
3. Evening: Organize and categorize new entries
4. Weekly: Review and refine organization system
