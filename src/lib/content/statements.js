## Introduction & Framing
**Motivation: Why multimodality matters in the evolution of UI**
Research Questions
- How can affordances guide multimodal UI design?
- What principles and heuristics can ensure affordances remain consistent and intuitive across devices, modalities, and environments?
- How might speculative design outputs reveal the possibilities and pitfalls of multimodal affordance-driven design?
## Theoretical Foundations
Affordances, Signifiers, Mappings, and Mental Models
- Gibson: ecological affordances.
- Norman: perceived vs. actual affordances; role of signifiers.
- Dourish: embodied affordances.
- Oviatt, Treisman, Clark & Brennan: multimodal cognition.
**Deepening the Affordance Lens**
- Affordances as dynamic contracts, not static properties.
- Plural, overlapping, and sometimes conflicting in multimodality.
- Emotional affordances as affective scaffolds.
**Linking Affordances to Multimodal Contexts**
- Extending across visual, auditory, haptic, and spatial modalities.
- Signifiers as plural yet coherent expressions of affordances.
## Multimodality in Context
**Defining Multimodality**
- Modalities as sensory and interaction channels (visual, auditory, haptic, cross-device, environmental).
- Human communication as naturally multimodal.
**Historical and Contemporary Precedents**
- From command lines to GUIs to touch to conversational agents.
- Today's landscape: smart speakers, wearables, AR/VR, IoT.
**Affordances as a Common Language Across Contexts**
- From interface to environment: spaces as interfaces.
- Affordance continuity across devices and modalities.
- Redundancy vs. complementarity of multimodal affordances.
- Affordances as systemic contracts within ecologies.
## Domains of Exploration
**Design Systems**
- How systems encode affordances across modalities.
- Opportunity: continuity rules across devices and senses.
**Design Language Evolution**
- Skeuomorphism → Flat → Material.
- Next Step: Environmental Affordances
- Toward a multimodal grammar of affordances.
- Rules for consistency, complementarity, and emotional tone across ecologies.
**Emotion in UI**
- Emotional affordances via voice, haptics, and ambient cues.
- Affect as central to intuitive multimodal design.
## Principles & Toolkit
**Affordance-Driven Principles for Multimodal UI**
- Synthesized from ecological, embodied, and cognitive theories.
**Heuristics or Evaluation Framework**
- Structured by modality, tested across ecologies.
## Applied Outputs / Speculative Demonstrations
**Mock-ups and Motion Studies**
**Interaction Scenarios**
- Case studies of continuity across devices.
**Case Study Remix**
- Reimagining existing products with affordance-centered design.
## Discussion & Conclusion
**Implications**
- For designers and HCI theory.
**Limitations**
- Risks of invisibility, complexity, or conflict.
**Future Research**
- Affordances for adaptive AI.
- Social and collective affordances in multi-user ecologies.
## Thesis Output
- A research-informed, design-led framework of affordance-driven principles for multimodal UI.
- Speculative prototypes and visualizations demonstrating application across contexts.

    content: `# Designing for the Multimodal Future: An Affordance-Centered Framework for Intuitive User Interfaces.
## Research Aim
To develop a set of affordance-driven principles for designing multimodal interfaces (spanning screen, peripheral, cross-device, and environmental contexts) and demonstrate their application through speculative design outputs.
## Structure
** 1. Introduction & Framing**
- Motivation: Why multimodality matters in the evolution of UI.
- Research questions: How can affordances guide multimodal UI design?
** 2. Theoretical Foundations** 
- Affordances, signifiers, mappings, and mental models (Gibson, Norman, Oviatt).
- Linking affordances to multimodal contexts.
** 3. Multimodality in Context**
- Defining multimodality (visual, auditory, haptic, cross-device).
- Historical and contemporary precedents.
** 4. Domains of Exploration**
- Design Systems: How they encode and extend affordances across modalities.
- Design Language Evolution: Skeuomorphism → Flat → Material → Toward environment-grounded languages.
- Emotion in UI: Emotional affordances in multimodal contexts (haptics, motion, ambient signals).
** 5. Principles & Toolkit**
- Synthesis of affordance-driven principles for multimodal UI.
- Heuristics or evaluation framework, structured by modality.
** 6. Applied Outputs / Speculative Demonstrations**
- Mock-ups, motion studies, and interaction scenarios showing principles in action.
** 7. Discussion & Conclusion**
- Reflection on implications, limitations, and future research.
## Thesis Output
A research-informed, design-led framework of affordance-driven principles for multimodal UI, accompanied by speculative prototypes and visualizations that demonstrate their application across devices and contexts.
