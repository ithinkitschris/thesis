    content: `## Core:
- Buxton, Bill. 2007. **Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design.**

    *Provides a historical and conceptual framework for interaction design, arguing for the importance of sketching and iteration. Connects technological development to design practice.*


- Card, Stuart K., Thomas P. Moran, and Allen Newell. 1983. **The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction.**

    *The foundational text for the "Model Human Processor" and GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection Rules), a landmark in applying cognitive psychology to predict user performance.*


- Engelbart, Douglas C. 1962. **"Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework."** 

    *Engelbart's seminal report outlining his vision for using computers to amplify human intelligence, laying the theoretical groundwork for the mouse, hypertext, and collaborative computing.*


- Johnson, Jeff, Teresa L. Roberts, William Verplank, David C. Smith, Charles H. Irby, Marian Beard, and Kevin Mackey. 1989. **"The Xerox Star: A Retrospective."** 

    *A firsthand account from the Xerox PARC and Star development teams detailing the design principles, user testing, and conceptual breakthroughs (e.g., desktop metaphor) behind the first commercial GUI.*


- Moggridge, Bill. 2007. **Designing Interactions.**

    *A collection of interviews with over 40 influential designers, providing primary-source accounts of key interaction design projects from the GUI to mobile devices.*


- Norman, Donald A. 2013. **The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition.**

    *Introduces foundational concepts like affordances, signifiers, conceptual models, and feedback. Though not strictly about UI, its principles are essential for understanding interaction design.*


- Shneiderman, Ben. 1983. **"Direct Manipulation: A Step Beyond Programming Languages."**

    *Formally defines "direct manipulation," articulating the principles of continuous representation, physical actions, and rapid, reversible operations that underpin modern GUIs.*


- Sutherland, Ivan E. 1963. **"Sketchpad: A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System."** 

    *The published version of Sutherland's PhD thesis, describing the first interactive graphical system with features like object-oriented drawing, constraints, and a light pen, a cornerstone of computer graphics and HCI.*


- Apple Computer, Inc. 1987. **Apple Human Interface Guidelines: The Apple Desktop Interface.**

    *The original HIG that codified the principles of the Macintosh desktop (e.g., consistency, user control, forgiveness). It established the canonical patterns for the WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer) paradigm.*


- Google. 2014. **[Material Design.](https://material.io/archive/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html)**

    *The specification for the first version of Material Design, which introduced a comprehensive, physics-based design system with principles of tactile surfaces, print-like typography, and meaningful motion.*


## Topics
### Proto-UI & Cybernetics
- **Bush, Vannevar. 1945. “As We May Think.” The Atlantic Monthly, July 1945.**

    *Takeaway: Proposed the "memex," a conceptual hypertext system that directly inspired future pioneers like Engelbart and Nelson.*


- Wiener, Norbert. 1948. **Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine.**

    *Established the principles of feedback and control systems, providing the theoretical language for understanding human-machine interaction as a conversation.*


- Müller-Brockmann, Josef. 1981. **Grid Systems in Graphic Design.**

    *The definitive text on Swiss Style typography and grid-based layout, which directly influenced the clean, structured aesthetic of modern UI from PARC to flat design.*


### Interactive Computing & The GUI
- Licklider, J. C. R. 1960. **"Man-Computer Symbiosis."** IRE Transactions on Human Factors in Electronics HFE-1 (1): 4–11.

    *Articulated the vision of a future partnership between humans and computers for real-time problem solving, moving beyond batch processing.*


- Kay, Alan C. 1977. **"Microelectronics and the Personal Computer."** Scientific American 237 (3): 230–44.

    *Described the Dynabook concept, a portable personal computer for children, which encapsulated the core ideas of GUIs, object-oriented programming, and user-centered design.*


- Smith, David Canfield, Charles Irby, Ralph Kimball, Bill Verplank, and Eric Harslem. 1982. **"Designing the Star User Interface."** Byte 7 (4): 242–82.

    *A more accessible, detailed look at the design process and rationale for the Xerox Star's interface, covering icons, windows, and the property sheet concept.*

### Web & Usability
- Nielsen, Jakob. 2000. **Designing Web Usability.**

    *Codified the core principles of usability for the web era, popularizing concepts like heuristic evaluation and user testing with data-driven, practical advice.*


- Krug, Steve. 2000. **Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability.**

    *Made usability accessible through its core mantra, emphasizing clarity, convention, and the elimination of cognitive friction for users.*


- Marcotte, Ethan. 2010. **"Responsive Web Design."** A List Apart, May 25, 2010.

    *The article that named and defined responsive web design (RWD), establishing the core techniques of fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries to adapt layouts across devices.*

### Mobile & Post-PC
- Vogel, Dan, and Patrick Baudisch. 2007. **"Shift: A Technique for Operating Pen-Based Interfaces Using Touch."** 

    *A key academic paper pre-iPhone that explored the "fat finger" problem and solutions for touch accuracy, representative of the research that paved the way for modern touch UIs.*


- Forstall, Scott, et al. 2007. **"Multi-touch gesture dictionary."** 

    *Not a reading, but a primary source showing the formal definition and patenting of the core multitouch gestures (pinch, swipe, etc.) that defined the first generation of iOS.*


- Matias, Duarte. 2011. **["Android Design: Android 3.0 Honeycomb."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcuDQd8SejM)** 

    *The public presentation of the Android Holo theme, which marked Google's first major, systematic effort to create a mature and distinct visual and interaction design language for its platform.*

### Design Systems & Modern Practice
- Frost, Brad. 2016. **"Atomic Design."** Brad Frost Web. June 10, 2016.

    *Introduced a methodology for creating design systems by breaking interfaces into fundamental components (atoms, molecules, organisms), providing a shared vocabulary for designers and developers.*


- Caled, W. G., P. G. Chisholm, and S. C. Gross. 1987. **"The IBM Systems Application Architecture Common User Access."** 

    *An official overview of IBM's Common User Access (CUA), the first major cross-platform design system aiming for interface consistency across operating systems, from mainframes to PCs.*


- WCAG Working Group. 2008. **"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0."** 

    *Established the modern, technology-agnostic principles for web accessibility (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust), becoming the basis for international standards and laws.*
